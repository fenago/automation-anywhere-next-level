In this lab, we will set up the automation anywhere in our machine.


**Note:** We will use Google Chrome browser to complete the labs.


So first we need to create a free account in automation anywhere.
So let's on Google, for example, search for `Automation Anywhere Community Edition`. It's the free edition to use.

And open another tab in the browser. Enter your username. Type your email and in password type the password that you received on the automation anywhere email.

So let's log in here.

I will type my email, the credentials and click in login.
